  <h1 class="py-2">About</h1>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="text-dark m-0">Right from our inception in 1988, <a href="http://www.taurusonline.net" target="_blank"><b>Taurus Hard Soft Solutions</b></a> has been working closely with some of the leading
      Scientific Research institutions in the country by providing IT solutions. With our longstanding association
      with these institutions, We understand their way of working and the challenges faced by the scientific and
      research community in the country . We strongly feel that with a change in approach to science and scientific
      knowledge dissemination, there can be a significant growth in this segment. We are on a journey to create a
      digital platform that can catalyse the growth of science.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p class="text-dark m-0">We believe that the main function of science should focus on cultural improvement by
      contribution to human knowledge. The need of the hour is to ensure that science does not remain confined to
      laboratories. It has to be integrated into the lives of the people, boosting the zeal of the budding scientists,
      who could do better in future.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p class="text-dark m-0">There has to be several “science-society” programs and our objective is for the
      cultivation and promotion of science in all its branches. We are associating with various institutes and
      organisations working with a similar objective to enable them for the promotion and outreach for publication of
      proceedings, journals, memoirs, transactions and other works.·</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>We strongly feel that the scientific community has a unique contribution to make not only to the flowering of
      science in India but also to national character and we want this platform to be an enabler for the same.</p>
